# Athena-Lamda-Splunk-Integration
The main.py file gives you a template on how to read big data sets stored in S3 like VPC Flow logs/ Cloudtrail/ EDR telemetry/ ELB access logs etc. When we donot have enough license to ingest everything into Splunk SIEM, we can leverage this solution to get critical insights into splunk for detections/threat hunt/threat intel correlation. This gives a jump start on Incident reponse and data correlation.

Most of the code has been taken in a modular fashion using ChatGPT and put together for the a working solution. Feel free to customize as per your source data and change the Splunk Ingest method to suit your environment.
